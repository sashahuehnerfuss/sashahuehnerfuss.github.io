			<p> I like to appreciate the little things in life, so I want to share some of my favorite things with you. I love sunny weather, tanning, swimming, the beach and all things summertime. Listening to music is something I look forward to doing everyday, and my favorite artist is TheWeeknd. Another one of my favorite things are my family, and my friends from both college and home. I feel my happiest spending time with the people I love. Another favorite thing of mine is going on walks. I love taking a relaxing stroll and feeling the sun, it makes me feel very good and positive. My favorite color is purple, favorite food is chicken tenders, favorite animal is butterflies, and favorite drink is sparkling water. Some more of my favorite things are sleeping, my bed, traveling and experiencing new places, sunsets, and a clean room. </p>
