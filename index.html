					<p style="color:purple">Hi! I'm Sasha Huehnerfuss, a current junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am majoring in Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies, with certificates of Entrepreneurship and Digital Studies. I grew up in Edgar, Wisconsin and attended highschool at Edgar High. Growing up I played volleyball, danced, and did some theater. I have been dancing at <b><a href="https://heidisdancestudio.com"> Heidi's Dance Studio </a></b> since I was two years old, and was a dance teacher for six years there. My mom actually owns the studio, so you could say dance runs in my blood. I currently still dance, and have continued playing volleyball on a recreational team with my friends. I have three siblings, one younger brother and two sisters. Fun fact, my sisters and I are actually triplets! That is just a little bit of information to get to know me.</p>

					<p>Within my journey here at Madison I have joined three clubs. Optima Dance, which I only did for one semester, SRA and the Pop Tab Cub, which I am currently still part of. For the upcoming summer I have an Internship with the Wausau Woodchucks Baseball and Softball teams as a Game Day experience Intern. Iâ€™m not exactly sure what I want my future career to look like, but I am interested in careers within the sports and retail fields. </p>

					<p> This is a photo of me on my family vacation this past January. We went to two of the Hawaiian Islands, The Big Island and Maui. I absolutely love everything about Hawaii. A goal of mine is to temporarily move there for around a year after I graduate with one of my friends. </p>
