				<p style="color:purple;"> For the most part school and my job as an Event Set Up Student Supervisor keep me pretty busy, but I still have quite a few hobbies that I like to do in my free time. I love being active, whether it is going to the gym, doing pilates, walking, running, dance, volleyball, or pickleball. I Overall enjoy moving my body, especially if it’s outside. Another thing I love doing is spending time with my friends and family. Whether it’s just talking, playing games, watching a movie, getting food,  or going out, I really enjoy spending time with people I love. On top of all this I do really enjoy time by myself, and usually I need time to recharge my social battery. Relaxing things I like to do by myself are reading books, journaling, coloring, and watching TV. My favorite shows at the moment are <i style="color:purple;">The Rookie</i> and <i style="color:purple;">Say Yes to the Dress</i>.</p>
