			<p> One thing that I love to do is travel. It is also a large goal of mine to do lots of traveling after I graduate, and throughout my life. I have been going on family vacations since sixth grade, and so far counting the United states I have been to four countries. The places we have gone are <b>Cancun</b>, <b>Riviera Maya </b>, <b>Turks and Caicos Islands</b>, <b>Dominican Republic</b>, <b>Grand Cayman</b>, and three of the Hawiian islands including <b>The Big Island</b>, <b>Maui</b>, and <b>Kaui</b>. Within the United States I have been to sixteen of the states. Some of my travel goals include going to Europe and exploring many of the countries in that area like France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, etc.. I would also love to travel to Italy and Greece. My biggest travel goal is actually to move to Hawaii after graduation. I have fallen in love with the islands and would love to move there for one or two years to enjoy the islands. While living there I would like to find a way to volunteer or positively help the Island in some way. </p>
